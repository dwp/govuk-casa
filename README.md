# CASA 

A framework for building forms based on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).


## Features

* Adopts the [GOVUK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) which provides well-researched, accessible markup out of the box
* Handles complex journey routing so you can easily tailor users' journeys to provide the best experience
* Multi-language support
* A small core, but highly extensible through hook and plugin mechanisms
* Built on ExpressJS so offers a shallow learning curve
* Distributable supports both ES6 and CommonJS codebases


## Getting started

```bash
npm -E @dwp/govuk-casa
```

* [Documentation](docs/index.md)
* [Examples](examples/)


## Migrating between versions

A series of migration guides are provided in [`docs/migration-guides/`](docs/migration-guides/) that should help you upgrade between major versions of CASA.

Also see our [list of upcoming deprecations](DEPRECATIONS.md) that are planned for delivery in the next major version.
