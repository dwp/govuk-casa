# Example: Fully Loaded

This example makes use of every CASA feature.

You'll notice that it doesn't import `@dwp/govuk-casa` anywhere, but rather `src/casa.js` directly.  This is because we also use this example app as the basis for our e2e testing.

```bash
# Install
npm i

# Run
DEBUG=casa* PORT=3000 npm start
```
