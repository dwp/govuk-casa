  // This "waypoint-change" event is triggered whenever data/validation
  // changes on a waypoint, just prior to it being committed to the session.

  // contact-details if entering a certain secret code. It does this by
  // invalidating the 'contact-details' waypoint, forcing the user to re-visit.

      }
    },
  },

  // This "context-change" event is triggered after all "waypoint-change"
  // events have been applied, and just prior to the context being committed to
  // the session.
  // In this example, we're using it to re-traverse our Plan and purge any state
  // from JourneyContext for those waypoints that are no longer visitable.
  //
  // BE CAREFUL WITH THIS: You might want to keep some waypoint data because
  // they're not traversable _yet_, but you know they may be. Tricky way to do
  // this cleanly en-mass. Better to use the `waypoint-change` events and
  // pinpoint the waypoints you want to purge.
