# Maintainers Guide

Please refer to our [Contributors Guide](docs/contributors/index.md) for more insights on how code should be structured and tested.

## Reviewing contributions

Review tips:

* Is the intent of the change clear? Ask for clarity if needed, whether that's documentation or a change to code.
* Does the change cater for the widest number of scenarios, or is it for a specific user-case? If the latter, explore with the contributor whether there is scope for generalising the solution.
* Is the solution optimal; using appropriate data structures and controls? If you have alternative suggestions, work with the contributor to explore the potential advantages of those alternatives approaches.
* Are tests included, and do they cover happy and unhappy paths appropriately?
* Confirm the change doesn't contain any exploitative or malicious code (whether intentional or not)
* If new dependencies are introduced, review those dependencies to get a sense of the community support behind it. Try to avoid including older, infrequently maintained modules, unless they are stable.
* Where content has been changed, has it been provided in all supported languages (English and Welsh)?
* Are commits squashed appropriately, where changes to the same scope are grouped into one commit?
* Ensure that the MR is rebased onto the tip of `main` branch
* Are any breaking changes introduced; if so does the commit log include a BREAKING CHANGE comment in the footer?
* Is documentation included where appropriate?

### Handling contributions from a GitHub PR

Review the contribution in GitHub, asking the questions above and ensuring the contribution meets guidelines documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; don't be shy about asking for changes (in the PR discussion) to meet these guidelines

Once the PR discussions are resolved (if any), on your local clone ensure you have latest source from the canonical internal repository:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
```

Checkout the Github PR with:

```bash
# Create a new local branch based on the contributor's name and branch, e.g.
# if "sue" wants to merge her "feature/thing" branch ...
git checkout -b sue-feature/thing main

# Pull the contributor's changes into that branch
git pull git://github.com/sue/sues-forked-repo.git feature/thing
```

Rebase the MR onto `main` to ensure it plays nicely with the latest integrated codebase. If there are conflicts at this stage, ask the contributor to bring their branch up to date with main:

```bash
git rebase main
```

Review the code locally first (see tips further above), before installing anything.

Push this branch up to the canonical internal repository, and create a new internal PR. At this point we review the code in the same manner as any other internal project.

```bash
git push -u origin sue-feature/thing
```

Review the code locally using the guidelines above, ensuring it builds, passes linting and tests. Use the `npm run pipeline` script to cover these checks (check for changes to those scripts beforehand).

If successful, merge into `main`, ensure CI build passes before finally pushing back up to GitHub and _closing_ (without merging) the original PR.

## Packaging a new version

Any commits pushed to `main` will automatically trigger the creation of a packaging branch and Merge Request. To tag that packaged version, simply merge the MR. To publish the package to the public npm registry, there is still a manual process to follow (see further below).

For any other branches (e.g. maintenance branches), you will currently still have to perform the following tasks to package:

```bash
# Package
git checkout -b chore/package
npx standard-version
git push -u origin head

# Create an MR from this branch, seek approval and merge. A new version will be
# automatically published to the internal GitLab registry.
```

Presently, publishing to the public npm registry is a manual process:

```bash
# Dry run first to check it all looks good
npm publish --dry-run

# For the `main` branch (will publish under the "latest" dist tag)
npm publish

# For the `maintain*` branches (use the appropriate tag)
npm publish --tag maintain7x
```
