# ---------------------------------------------------------- blueprint overrides 

# The unit tests rely on sources in dist/, and the `prepare` npm script will
# throw a "cannot run in wd" failure due to permissions (in the blueprint,
# `npm ci` is run as root, so we either need `--unsafe-perm` or run manually).
# So we run that manually.
