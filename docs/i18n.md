# Internationalisation

Translations are carried out through simple dictionary files, in either JSON or Yaml formats.

Uncer the hood, the **[`18next`](https://www.i18next.com/)** library is used to perform the translations.

On each request, a `req.t()` function is available to perform translations in code.

On each template, a `t()` function is available to perform translations within templates.


## Dictionaries

You can specify as many dictionary folders as you wish, and they must each match this structure:

```
/my-folder
  /en
    /file1.yaml
    /file2.json
    ...
  /cy
    /file1.yaml
    /file.json
    ...
```

Yaml is probably a better choice as it's less verbose and supports [multiline content](https://yaml-multiline.info/).

Each file corresponds to a **namespace**, and the entries in that file correspond to **keys**. For example, given this dictionary ...

```yaml
# welcome.yaml
page_title: Hello, {{ salutation }}!
fields:
  name:
    label: What's your name?
```

Then you'd access these keys as so, in Nunjucks:

```jinja
<h1>{{ t('welcome:page_title', { salutation: 'World' }) }}</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">
  {{ t('welcome:fields.name.label') }}
</p>
```

This example also demonstrates i18next's [string interpolation](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/interpolation) capability.
