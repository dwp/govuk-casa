# Hooks

Use the hooks mechanism to insert ExpressJS middleware functions in various places on CASA's core routers.

These additional middleware are mounted at boot time, so there are no runtime-checks for hooks.

## Global hooks

Hooks are scoped to one of the core CASA routers:

- `static` - The static router, serving up resources such as CSS, JS, images, fonts, etc
- `ancillary` - A set of other routes to handle generic pages, such as the `session-timeout` page
- `journey` - The journey router that provides interactive routes for every waypoint in your Plan

Each router exposes its own unique hooks, named in the format `<scope>.<hook>`.

For example, to create a hook on the `journey.prerender` hook that will run for every route in the `journeyRouter` router:

```javascript
configure({
  hooks: [
    {
      hook: "journey.prerender",
      middleware: (req, res, next) => {
        console.log(`About to render ${req.path} ...`);
        next();
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Page-specific hooks

You can specify hooks on your page definitions as a convenient way of creating per-page hooks. For example, the two methods below are equivalent:

```javascript
// Using page-specific hooks
configure({
  pages: [
    {
      waypoint: "test-waypoint",
      hooks: [
        {
          hook: "prerender",
          middleware: () => {},
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

// Using global hooks
configure({
  pages: [
    {
      waypoint: "test-waypoint",
    },
  ],
  hooks: [
    {
      hook: "journey.prerender",
      path: "/test-waypoint",
      middleware: () => {},
    },
  ],
});
```

Page hooks are always run _after_ global hooks.

| Hook                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `journey.presteer` / `journey.poststeer`       | Runs before & after logic that prevents the user from "jumping ahead" in the Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `journey.presanitise` / `journey.postsanitise` | Runs before & after the `req.body` gets cleaned up ready for ingestion                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `journey.pregather` / `journey.postgather`     | Runs before & after data is ingested into `req.casa.journeyContext` and saved in the session                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `journey.prevalidate` / `journey.postvalidate` | Runs before & after data in `req.casa.journeyContext` is validated. If validation fails, a `req.casa.validationErrors` object will be present to hooks on `journey.postvalidate`. In this case, your hook should still call `next()` so the errors can be presented to the user. |
| `journey.preredirect`                          | Runs before the user is redirected to the next waypoint in their journey                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `journey.prerender`                            | Runs before the a waypoint's page is rendered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
