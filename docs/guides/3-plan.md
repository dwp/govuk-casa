# Designing a Plan

A _Plan_ in CASA simply describes the sequence of web pages that a user visits during their session.

The simplest plan is a linear, one-page-after-the-other affair. However, you can also go to town and design complex journeys that take the user off on tangents (and back again, or not) depending on the data they are providing during their session.

For all the examples below, we recommend defining your Plan in its own file, wrapped in a function so that you can easily inject configuration at runtime, if needed. For example:

```javascript
/* definitions/plan.js */

module.exports = () => {
  const plan = new Plan();
  // ...
  return plan;
};
```

## Terminology

* **Plan**: The sum of all _Waypoints_, _Routes_ and _Origins_
* **Waypoint**: A visitable point in a user's journey through your plan
* **Route**: A connection between any two Waypoints in the plan; can be directed either two-ways, or one-way between the waypoints
* **Origin**: A point within the Plan from which traversals will be started; at least one origin must be defined
* **Condition**: A boolean decision of whether a particular route will be followed or not during a traversal
* **Journey Context**: Some state information about the user's interaction with the Plan (contains data and validation state)

Whilst the terms _Waypoint_ and _Page_ are interchangeable for the most part, you should think of _Waypoints_ as abstractions, and _Pages_ as concrete implementations (i.e. visible web pages) of the same concept.

## Simple linear routes

Connect two waypoints with a two-way route as follows:

```javascript
const { Plan } = require('@dwp/govuk-casa');

const plan = new Plan();
plan.setRoute('a', 'b');
plan.addOrigin('main', 'a');
```

> NOTE: an origin is mandatory; however, when only one origin is defined, its name is irrelevant (we have use `main` above)

![simple two-way route between a and b][building-blocks-ab]

Note that the `next` and `prev` route labels are important, and used in certain forwards/backwards traversal scenarios.

For convenience, you can setup a sequence of two-way routes using the `Plan.addSequence()` method:

```javascript
const { Plan } = require('@dwp/govuk-casa');

const plan = new Plan();
plan.addSequence('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e');
plan.addOrigin('main', 'a');
```

![sequence between a and e][building-blocks-ae]

You can also create one-way routes. This can be useful if you want to force a user's journey to go back to a different waypoint than the one just visited:

```javascript
const { Plan } = require('@dwp/govuk-casa');

const plan = new Plan();
plan.setRoute('a', 'b');
plan.setNextRoute('b', 'c');
plan.setPrevRoute('c', 'a');
plan.addOrigin('main', 'a');
```

## Route conditions

You can attach conditions to routes that control how the user traverses through them. By default, there are conditions attached to each route that will prevent them being traversed unless the following are satisifed:

* The "source" waypoint has been successfully validated (i.e. validation has been executed, and no errors found)

However, you can override this behaviour with your own conditional functions, which must match the following signature:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {object} route Information about the route being traversed
 * @param {JourneyContext} context Contextual state information
 * @returns {boolean} whether the route should be followed or not
 */
myCondition = (route, context) => {
  return trueOrFalse;
};
```

See [Journey State](docs/topics/journey-state.md) for more information on how to use instances of the [`JourneyContext`](lib/JourneyContext.js) class.

Here's a simple example that checks the journey's data context to determine whether one route or the other should be followed:

```javascript
const { Plan } = require('@dwp/govuk-casa');

const plan = new Plan();
plan.setRoute('a', 'b', (r, c) => (c.data.a.ticked === true));
plan.setRoute('a', 'c', (r, c) => (c.data.a.ticked !== true));
plan.setRoute('b', 'c');
plan.addOrigin('main', 'a');
```

When `ticked` is `true`, the traversal sequence will be: `a <--> b <--> c`

When `ticked` is `false` the traversal sequence will be: `a <--> c`

![conditional route][building-blocks-route-condition]

**NOTE:** When you define a cutom route condition, CASA will still perform its own checks before running your condition (specifically, that the "source" waypoint has passed validation). You can override this behaviour by toggling the `validateBeforeRouteCondition` flag when creating a Plan, e.g:

```javascript
const plan = new Plan({
  validateBeforeRouteCondition: false,
});
```

### How changing answers effects the user's journey

If a user goes back to modify any of their answers, this may well alter how their onward journey unfolds.

Internally, CASA takes a snapshot of their journey both before and after submitting their changes, then compares the two to determine where to send the user next.

The rules that govern how a user is redirected are outlined below:

| "Before" | "After" | Rules |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `a, b, c` | `a, b, x, c` | A new waypoint `x` has been inserted, so the user will stop at `x` |
| `a, b, c, d` | `a, b, d` | Waypoint `c` has been removed from the middle of a journey, so the user will stop at the last incomplete waypoint, `d` |
| `a, b, c, d` | `a, c, d` | _(as above)_ |
| `a, b, c` | `a, c, d` | Waypoint `b` has been removed, and `d` has been added to the end; user will stop at the new waypoint, `d` |

## Multiple origins

Origins are a useful tool to effectively segment a user's journey through your service into separate chunks.

For example, you might have a "spine" page that links to a series of separate workflows. In this scenario, you would define origins for the spine and each workflow:

```javascript
const { Plan } = require('@dwp/govuk-casa');

const plan = new Plan();

plan.addSequence('a', 'b', 'c');

plan.addSequence('name', 'age', 'dob');

plan.addSequence('outdoors', 'indoors');

plan.addOrigin('spine', 'a');
plan.addOrigin('user-details', 'name');
plan.addOrigin('hobbies', 'outdoors');
```

Now, a user can visit the following URLs to start traversing from that origin's start waypoint:

* `/spine/a` follows `a <--> b <--> c`
* `/user-details/name` follows `name <--> age <--> dob`
* `/hobbies/outdoors` follows `outdoors <--> indoors`

## Looping routes

If your service includes some form of repetitive data gathering, such as collecting details for an arbitrary number of bank accounts a user has, then you may find **[Ephemeral Contexts](docs/topics/ephemeral-contexts.md)** helpful. These are temporary Journey Contexts that can be used to guide the user along a particular route to gather data before then being discarded.

## Visualising the Plan

The Plan is described by a directed graph data structure under the hood, which can be used to a generate simple visualisation, using [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/), for example.

You can get hold of this raw graph structure by using the `plan.getGraphStructure()` method. Here's a very simplistic example of how to convert the graph into a DOT language representation, which can then be fed into Graphviz:

```javascript
const graphlib = require('@dagrejs/graphlib');
const dot = require('graphlib-dot');
const { Plan } = require('@dwp/govuk-casa');

const plan = new Plan();
plan.addSequence('a', 'b', 'c');
plan.addSequence('name', 'age', 'dob');

// JSON serialisation is needed to remove any undefined labels, which can trip
// up graphlib-dot
const graph = plan.getGraphStructure();
const json = JSON.stringify(graphlib.json.write(graph));
const graphcopy = graphlib.json.read(JSON.parse(json));

process.stdout.write(dot.write(graphcopy));
```

### Labelling graph edges

Graph edges (routes) will be labelled with the name of the routing function.
For example:

```javascript
plan.setRoute('start', 'forest', function goNorth(r, c) {
  return c.data.a.direction === 'north';
});
```

The edge will be labelled `start <-- goNorth --> forest`.

Arrow functions assume the names of the variables they were initially assigned to,
anonymous functions will have blank labels:

```javascript
// `start <-- goEast --> cave`
const goEast = (r, c) => c.data.start.direction === 'east';
plan.setRoute('start', 'east', goEast);

// `start <-----> castle`
plan.setRoute('start', 'south', (r, c) => c.data.start.direction === 'south');
plan.setRoute('start', 'south', function (r, c) {
  return c.data.start.direction === 'south';
});
```

If you are using a higher order function to produce routing conditions you can dynamically
assign function names (and therefore route labels):

```javascript
// Field in source waypoint is equal to value
const isEqualTo = (field, value) => {
  const name = `"${field}" equals "${value}"`;
  // This arrow function will assume the name of the object property it is
  // assigned to, we can use this to set it dynamically based on input. It will
  // retain this name after it is returned even if it is not assigned to a variable.
  return { [name]: (r, c) => c.data[r.source][field] === value }[name];
};

// `start <-- "direction" equals "west" --> field`
plan.setRoute('start', 'field', isEqualTo('direction', 'west'));
```

The original name will be retained even if nested further:

```javascript
const walkTo = direction => isEqualTo('direction', direction);

// `start <-- "direction" equals "west" --> field`
plan.setRoute('start', 'field', walkTo('west'));
```
