# `postalAddressObject`

Validates UK postal addresses captured through the [`casaPostAddressObject()`](views/casa/components/postal-address-object/README.md) macro, which arrive as separate values for the street name/number (`address1`), additional street information (`address2`), town/city (`address3`), county (`address4`) and postcode (`postcode`).

```javascript
import { validators } from "@dwp/govuk-casa";
// Minimal
validators.postalAddressObject.make();
```

```javascript
// All configuration options
validators.postAddressObject.make({
  // Limit the length of each address line (address1 - 4)
  strlenmax: 100,

  // Define components as being required. By default, required fields are
  // `address1`, `address3`, `postcode`
  requiredFields: ["address1", "address3", "postcode"],

  // Error messages
  errorMsgAddress1: {
    summary: "validation:rule.postalAddressObject.address1.summary",
    focusSuffix: "[address1]",
  },
  errorMsgAddress2: {
    summary: "validation:rule.postalAddressObject.address2.summary",
    focusSuffix: "[address2]",
  },
  errorMsgAddress3: {
    summary: "validation:rule.postalAddressObject.address3.summary",
    focusSuffix: "[address3]",
  },
  errorMsgAddress4: {
    summary: "validation:rule.postalAddressObject.address4.summary",
    focusSuffix: "[address4]",
  },
  errorMsgPostcode: {
    summary: "validation:rule.postalAddressObject.postcode.summary",
    focusSuffix: "[postcode]",
  },
});
