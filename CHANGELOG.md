# [4.0.0](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/compare/3.0.1...4.0.0) (2019-05-17)


### Features

* **session:** pass referer url in session-timeout redirect ([7e0b3d0](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/7e0b3d0)), closes [#56](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/issues/56)


### Performance Improvements

* **nunjucks:** improve performance of template rendering and loading ([0838fbc](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/0838fbc))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **nunjucks:** Macros now require access to the same scope as the
templates being rendered, so must be imported with context. See
docs/MIGRATING-3.x-4.x.md

# [3.0.0](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/compare/2.4.2...3.0.0) (2019-05-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **security:** remove 'unsafe-inline' from script src in CSP header ([e6a4fbd](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/e6a4fbd))
* **security:** set x-xss-protection header to `1; mode=block` ([9824762](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/9824762))


### Code Refactoring

* remove sass and uglify; compile assets at build time ([97c2ceb](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/97c2ceb))
* remove v1 macros and CSS ([40a419a](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/40a419a))


### Features

* add support for `report-uri` and `report-to` CSP directives ([2616f44](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/2616f44))
* add support for mulitple user journey maps ([c56211b](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/c56211b))


### Performance Improvements

* some small performance improvements to headers middleware ([4831264](https://github.com/dwp/govuk-casa/commit/4831264))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* If your service relies on CASA running sass/uglify
compilation at boot-time, this will no longer be the case and your
sources will need to be compiled in an alternative way.

* Any templates using the v1 macros or CSS/Sass rules
will need to migrate to using latest equivalents. See
docs/MIGRARTING-2.x-3.x.md for more details.

* **security:** Having 'unsafe-inline' set by default in the CSP header
prevents protection against XSS attacks by allowing any inline JS to be
executed in the browser. I'm removing this in favour of developers
explicitly allowing each inline script block.

* The review page page is no longer automatically added and
must now be manually defined in page meta config. Conditional waypoint syntax
change.
